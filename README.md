It can help you kick-start a build-workflow for your WordPress plugins and themes with `Gulp.js`, save you a lot of grunt work time, follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, and `#0CJS` Zero-config JavaScript startup but still configurable via `wpgulp.config.js` file.

# 1— Install WPGulp in your WordPress theme/plugin.
npx wpgulp
# 2— Now configure variables inside the `wpgulp.config.js` file.
# 3— Start your npm build workflow.
npm start
